----------------   TAINTED PLANET VISION ------------------------------

A vision should have the following:

-What the project should accomplish
-Why the project deserves to exist
-Success Criteria


WHAT?

Tainted Planet is a casual video game designed for the iphone. It is a both a fun and simple game
that lets users play with gravity to navigate. 


WHY? 

Not do only we want to do it....but no such game exists anyways! It will be an interesting opportunity
to implement XP.

SUCCESS CRITERIA?

Several Stages and on 2 Fronts ( XP and the Game Itself):

1 Stage:

	Game:
		Upon game completion ( 10 levels minimum), both of us must beat the game :).
	XP:
		-The project must have every public object interface tested with TDD.
		-A normal team velocity has been established.
